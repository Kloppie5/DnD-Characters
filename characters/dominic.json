  "name": "Dominic Wilken",
  
  "bio": "During a growing conflict between major powers, Dominic was helpless to stop the destruction of his village. He volunteered for a secretive project to help end the war, one way or another. For this experiment, his memory was wiped and his body was infused with the power of The Void. Unable to speak and going by the name Umbra, he underwent many experiments in an attempt to control his void, but it kept lashing out around him. At some point he broke free and caused a massacre. After his recapture, he was exposed to The Universal Clock. Ever since then, he has heard the ticking of The Universal Clock. It calmed the void inside of him and gave him insight into the true nature of the world; he can sense the vibrations of the universe and follows the will of The Universal Clock in fighting 'elegant malevolence, sequestered in the resonance'. Part of this was realizing the mistake it was to try and control The Void, and as such he went around and killed everyone who was involved in the project.",

  "body": "Dominic is a fairly tall humanoid made of a very dark purple, almost black substance. He has light purple eyes and can tear the front of his face open to reveal a mouth full of sharp spikes. He is essentially formless, but he concentrates his mass into a humanoid shape of lighter purple, oily void, with a shell of dense, solid void. When in great distress, or unconscious for over 10 hours, his shape becomes less solid and more whispy, like smoke.",
  
  "appearance": "Using his Watch of the Void, he appears as a human with fair copper skin, short brown hair and yellow eyes. His blood looks red until it is far enough away from his body. His type is hidden from divination magic.",

A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. A creature regains its Bardic Inspiration die when it finishes a long rest."
