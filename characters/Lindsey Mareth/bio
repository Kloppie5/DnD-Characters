                                      Sigurd "Mareth"                                                      Lindsey Mareth

Daughter of Petra Mareth, a well respected golemancer specializing in very resilient golems for disaster search and rescue;
and Tiberius Declay, an ex adventuring bard that gained an incredibly long life span, who spent his time as a bard entertaining the people in a small town, until a landslide ruined the town, after which he met Petra. He assisted Petra in her work, and they fell in love.

Her mother died when Lindsey was 2 during a search and rescue when a building she was in suddenly collapsed. Her aunt, Katryne, made sure all the money earned from the golems didn't go to Tiberius and Lindsey, claiming that all of it was property of the overarching Mareth company. Tiberius, had a hard time raising Lindsey on his own, scraping by with little money. When Lindsey was 6, Tiberius got in touch with an old adventuring partymember to try to pull off a butter related heist, which landed him in prison.

When Tiberius got thrown into prison, it was the first time Lindsey's uncle Arthur even heard of her existence. He took her in and provided for her, though he was preoccupied most of the time, so it was an emotionally distant relationship.

She used to have an imaginary friend she called Heather. "She wasnt imaginary, she just happened to never be around when others were around." Heather was always really understanding and a very good listener.

Arthur has a high-standing wife called Zephie Sunport, but it is a loveless, political marriage, in which both have a partner as part of the staff. Zephie has a partner called Nol Bramble, with whom she has a son called Sigurd Mareth, taking on the Mareth name, pretending the child is Arthur's. Arthur has a partner called Larzo Marenwood, the head of staff. Lindsey is not allowed to call Nol and Larzo "uncle" when others are over.
Sigurd is two years older than Lindsey, but dumb as rocks and very smug. He has the advantage though that he is not from a "ruined branch of the family", so she dislikes him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When she was 11, she once joined Arthur on a business trip to the Elemental Plane of Water. They went to a huge domed city underwater. She fell in love with the calmth and beauty of the underwater world. She also met Benjamin, a Triton. He gave her a small metal fish trinket that she still has on her bracelet. She had her first crush on him, but he was 20 at the time, and she doesn't know what he thought of her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When she was 15, she lost her virginity to a 16 year old human sorcerer named Ricky and his water elemental. In hindsight, Ricky wasn't that good, and she liked the elemental more.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With few obligations and a huge library at her disposal, she loved getting lost in the many interesting sections, and eventually started messing around with Arthur's alchemy supplies. She has an amazing memory and is very smart, but she is also very naive and has no common sense. Lindsey has spend many nights going out, having several friends with benefits. Arthur thinks that Lindsey should use her talents better, and therefore chose to allow her to study at Strixhaven.
