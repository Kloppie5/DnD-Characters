Wandering Shop:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After classes, we spend time in the Firejolt Cafe.
On the day of Aurora's Hurdy Gurdy performance, we were asked to go to the Fireside Lounge.

Nuala      is racing the purple frog with the bowtie, Bob.
Rozie      is racing the red    frog with suspenders.
Quintilius is racing the blue   frog with a cape.
Larene     is racing the orange frog with a tophat, Dapper frog.

Lindsey is cheering on the frog with a tophat. "Go mr. dapper!"
Willow  is heckling Quintilius.

After the race, in which Bob and Dapper frog tied, the frogs started growing, and their eyes started glowing red.
A female elf, Ellina Tenderwood, owner of the cafe, enters the room and helps out.
After combat, Lindsey took Dapper Frog's tophat.
The frogs came from the Archway Commons, they were already glowing.
They have eaten a strange black oozing, sweet smelling, substance.
Bob has joined the party.
