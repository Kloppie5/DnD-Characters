After Daniel got possessed, he had to watch as Mephistopheles made him kill his friend Gabriel and hundreds of people without Daniel being able to stop him.

This led to both sides of the war becoming extremely wary of the mountain, which lead to the eventual victory for [city]. As the bloodshed slowed down, Daniel got back control.

In a fit of rage, he went around slaughtering everyone in the compound, after which his void became quiet and unresponsive. Having come into contact with The Universal Clock and partially attuned to The Void, Dominic can sense the vibrations of the universe and follows the will of The Universal Clock. Dominic is a fairly tall 'human' made of a dark, unknown substance. He appears to have fair copper skin, brown hair and yellow eyes.

At the age of 11, a travelling salesman notices she was capable of rather complex magic for an urchin and offered to pay for her to go to a proper college in exchange for eventually paying it back double. Topaz did well in college, but was annoyed with how people only learn to cast spells created long ago and started spending the night in the forbidden library learning how to create spells.
