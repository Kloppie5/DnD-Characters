When the demon's soul was eventually released, nobody was near him anymore, Daniel above the ground being the nearest living being, so the demon latched on to him. After Daniel got possessed, he had to watch as Mephistopheles made him kill his friend Gabriel and hundreds of people without Daniel being able to stop him. Mephistopheles was in control and indiscriminately killed everyone he encountered on the mountain. This led to both sides of the war becoming extremely wary of the mountain, which lead to the eventual victory for [city]. As the bloodshed slowed down, Daniel got back control. While Mephistopheles also killed friendly forces, he was pardoned and giving a special forces rank for his service. Daniel has become alcoholic and pacifistic.

During his final experiment, he was exposed to The Universal Clock in a complex ritual. This calmed the void inside of him and gave him insight into the true nature of the world and his past. In a fit of rage, he went around slaughtering everyone in the compound, after which his void became quiet and unresponsive. Having come into contact with The Universal Clock and partially attuned to The Void, Dominic can sense the vibrations of the universe and follows the will of The Universal Clock. Dominic is a fairly tall 'human' made of a dark, unknown substance. He appears to have fair copper skin, brown hair and yellow eyes. When in great distress, his shape becomes less solid and more whispy, like smoke. He uses a silver necklace with a watch, ornated with cog symbols, to stay together.

He is able to telepathically speak with the person attuned to him. If someone wears Shay during a long rest, Shay will force the soul out of their body, leaving a braindead husk. Shay can control an attuned husk, but also feels whatever the husk feels. If attunement is broken through Remove Curse, Shay can't reattune with the husk. After a group of adventurers escaped the colosseum and killed the Arch-Fey, Shay was left in a bag of holding for an unknown amount of time, until he was eventually sold to a jeweller.

While living on the streets, Topaz stole a merchant's booklet with cantrips and learned how to use magic. At the age of 11, a travelling salesman notices she was capable of rather complex magic for an urchin and offered to pay for her to go to a proper college in exchange for eventually paying it back double. Topaz did well in college, but was annoyed with how people only learn to cast spells created long ago and started spending the night in the forbidden library learning how to create spells. After finding out the college has been faking accidents in order to sell off students, she stole some books from the forbidden library, left proof of the sales for the travelling salesman as repayment, and left the city at the age of 13.";
